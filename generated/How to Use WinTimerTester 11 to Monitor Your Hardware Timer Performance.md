## What is a Hardware Timer?
 
A hardware timer is a component of your computer that generates periodic signals to synchronize the operations of the CPU, GPU, and other devices. The hardware timer can have different resolutions, which determine how often the signals are sent. The higher the resolution, the more accurate and precise the timing is.
 
The default resolution of the hardware timer in Windows is usually 15.6 milliseconds, which means that the signals are sent every 15.6 milliseconds. However, some applications and games may require a higher resolution to run smoothly and reduce input lag. For example, Timer Resolution is a tool that can modify the default timer resolution of your monitor to improve gaming performance.
 
## Why Use WinTimerTester 1.1?
 
WinTimerTester 1.1 is a simple and lightweight utility that can access the high precision event timer (HPET) built into your computer. The HPET is a hardware timer that has a very high resolution of about 0.1 microseconds, which means that the signals are sent every 0.1 microseconds. The HPET can be enabled or disabled by your BIOS settings or by Windows.
 
WinTimerTester 1.1 can show you the current values of your hardware timer, such as the frequency, period, and ratio. You can also start, stop, and reset the monitoring process. By using WinTimerTester 1.1, you can check if your HPET is enabled or disabled, and how it affects your system performance.
 
## How to Download and Use WinTimerTester 1.1?
 
To download WinTimerTester 1.1, you can visit this website[^1^] and click on the Download button. The file size is only 0.8 MB and it does not require installation. You can also place it on a removable storage drive and run it on any computer.
 
To use WinTimerTester 1.1, you just need to launch the executable file and you will see a small window with all the relevant information about your hardware timer. To start the timer, you need to click on the Start button. You can also stop or reset the process by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
 
If the last value in the Ratio section displays 1.0000 or more, it means that your HPET is enabled. If the number is less than 1.0000, it means that your HPET is disabled. You can compare the values of your hardware timer with and without HPET to see how it affects your system performance.
 
## Conclusion
 
WinTimerTester 1.1 is a handy tool that can help you monitor your hardware timer performance and optimize your system performance. It is free, portable, and easy to use. You can download it from this website[^1^] and try it out yourself.
